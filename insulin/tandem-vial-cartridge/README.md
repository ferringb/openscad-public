Note: this is an older design I don't use.

Modification is likely necessary; in particular I recall that the tolerance on the circumference of the vial was
a bit too tight, and a hole should be made at the bottom for air pressure reasons (pulling a vial out gets *tough*).

Additionally, my original intention was to store pre-prepared reservoirs with insulin; this is a bad idea.  There is a
set lifespan for the reservoir's internal contact w/ insulin; preparing it earlier would just accelerate that problem.
What I'm describing there is why tandem is particular about the 3 day limit; my personal experience is you can reuse
a reservoir until around ~14d (long story) before the problem makes the reservoir entirely unusable, but your mileage
may vary.
